## Elevator Pitch
When “Restaurant goers” can’t decide what they want to eat, Grubbr can help them swipe through restaurants nearby or in searched cities with your friends. The user will be able to add friends that have common restaurants and start chatting or set up a date!

## User Stories
The User: Anyone who likes to go to restaurants, especially people who like to try new restaurants and also needs a date, either a friend or a romantic one.
Well, have you ever been with a partner/friend and you get into an argument because you both cant figure out what to eat? Grubbr can help people make friends based on the same types of restaurants they like.

- Nav Bar:
    - Accessible on everypage are the 'favorited restaurants' page which is the page where the user call see all the restaurants theyve liked
    - Accessible on everypage is also the 'matches' page where the user can see everyone they have matched with and everyone they have sent a match request to but have not responded yet
    - The User Profile page is accessible after a user has sign in or after they have signed up and created a profile, on this page the user can see, edit and delete their profile

- Page Flow for Users
     - When the user goes to the app they they will an option to 'create an account' or 'log in', if user needs to sign up they will be taken to a 'create profile' page where they would have to put in their informaiton, if the user has an account after signing they will be directed to 'Search by zipcode' page where they would be able to enter a zipcode and search for resturants in that area.
     - One the 'Restaurant slide'page, the user will look through restaurants that they may like and not like that has some informaiton on the restaurant, name, photo, address, if restaurant is open or not and price
     - If the user likes a restaurant they will be taken to a 'restaurant profile' page where they can see more information on the restaurant and can also see comments that other users on Grubbr have made about this restaurant as well as other Grubbr users who liked this resturant.
     - While on the resturant page, the user can request to add someone as a match and comment on the restaurant themselves.
